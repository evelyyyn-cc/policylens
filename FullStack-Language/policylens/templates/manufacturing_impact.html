                    Industrial Production Index (IPI) measures the real output of the three main industrial sectors in Malaysia: 
                    mining, manufacturing, and electricity. It serves as a key indicator of industrial activity and economic performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this analysis, we focus on how Malaysia's diesel subsidy policy affects the manufacturing sector, 
                    which contributes approximately 23% to the country's GDP and employs over 2.2 million workers.

                    <ul class="observation-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Apr–Jul 2023:</strong> 
                            Manufacturing output plunged by 2.1 % y/y at its weakest point, driven primarily by softer global demand, 
                            semiconductor supply-chain disruptions, and firms' destocking—policy-driven fuel costs played no part.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Aug–Dec 2023:</strong> 
                            Output stabilized around flat (±0.1 % y/y) as companies implemented tighter working-capital management, 
                            deferred non-critical capital expenditures, and shifted toward just-in-time inventories to preserve cash flow.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Jan 2024:</strong>
                            The government's announcement of a move to targeted diesel subsidies prompted manufacturers to hedge fuel exposure and renegotiate long-term transport contracts, 
                            signaling a shift in cost-management strategies even before prices changed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>10 Jun 2024:</strong> 
                            The blanket diesel subsidy was removed in Peninsular Malaysia (price rose from RM 2.15 to RM 3.35/L), 
                            increasing average logistics and on-site energy costs by roughly 30 %. 
                            Manufacturers responded with accelerated cost-pass-through, renegotiated supplier rates, 
                            and increased automation to offset higher fuel expenses.
                        </li>

                            <strong>Jul 2024–Jan 2025:</strong> 
                            Despite higher diesel prices, output rebounded strongly (+3 %–5 % y/y), 
                            driven by renewed export orders, strategic inventory restocking, 
                            and a 4 % improvement in energy intensity per unit of output—underscoring the sector's resilience and adaptability.

                    (which serve the local market). Each responds differently to diesel subsidy policy changes.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Consumer Prices:</strong> Domestic manufacturing sectors can partially pass costs to local consumers, contributing to inflationary pressure

                        <li>
                            <strong>Employment Effects:</strong> Export sectors typically employ more workers, so their volatility can have larger employment impacts
