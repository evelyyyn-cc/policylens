I have significantly modularised the front end following software design principles. Our original frontend 
code was too complex and cumbersome to use and fix.

Key Points:
1. Only main is supposed to be compiled now. So there is only 1 main file where changes are stored when it is compiled.

2. Please make changes to have the compiler only compile main. Right now all scss files are being compiled in here. 

3. main.scss only imports the respective partial scss. Partial scss are scss files that begin with _scss

4. All html files only are reading from main.scss. 

5. Copy over the html files from the "html-pages" folder and replace the existing html files.
